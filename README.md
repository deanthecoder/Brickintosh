# üß± Brickintosh

A tiny Lego Macintosh powered by an ESP32-S3 + 1.69" LCD display.  
It looks like a Mac, boots as a ZX Spectrum, loads MacOS 9, and occasionally throws a kernel panic just to keep you guessing.  
Because why settle for one retro system when you can mash them all together?

## üõ† Hardware

- [ESP32-S3 Dev Board with 1.69" IPS ST7789 LCD](https://thepihut.com/products/esp32-s3-development-board-with-1-69-lcd-display-240-x-280)  
- Lego bricks (to taste) for the iconic case.  

---

## üì¶ Software

- [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) for LCD driving.  
- RGB565-encoded visuals.

## üñ• ESP_SIM

`ESP_SIM` is a simple `main.cpp` file that uses [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) to emulate the output of the ESP32 device. This allows testing and code iterations quickly and easily on the desktop, before deploying to the actual hardware.

---

## üöÄ Build & Run

### ESP32

Build and flash the firmware using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO with VS Code. Connect your ESP32-S3 device and upload the code directly to the hardware.

### ESP_SIM

To run the ESP_SIM emulator on your desktop, ensure you have SDL2 installed. Compile `main.cpp` using your preferred C++ compiler or build system in VS Code. Once compiled, run the executable to emulate the device output on your computer.
